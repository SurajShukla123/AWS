Here I have wrote down some simple yaml file for creating AWS resources in CloudFormatin 

1. Go to CloudFormation in AWS mgmt console 
2. Choose create stack
3. Here you will get three option choose ready template 
4. Upload your yaml file inside it
5. If u want u can see in designer and validate ur template there it will show if is there is any error
6. Now add that 
7. Write your logical stack name 
8. Leave everything default 
9. Save it and that's it
10.Now go to the services and check thre it will show that ec2 or whatever is getting created 
11. Also u can track that thing in Stack event it will show u kind of log 
12. Once everything is done you can delete that stack under stack section
